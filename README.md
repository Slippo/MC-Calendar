# MC Calendar
A Spigot plugin that tells you the current date of your Minecraft world.

As a Minecraft world progresses, the current day can normally be viewed in the F3 menu. Usually in the style of "Day: 230".
This plugin will allow users to enter commands to tell them the exact year, week, or day depending on this value and the configuration chosen by the owner.
